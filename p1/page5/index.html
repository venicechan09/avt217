	<h2>Why do house <a href="../page6/index.html" title="next page">cats</a> have so many vocalizations compared with wildcats?</h2>
	<p> House cats are much noisier than <a href="https://www.alleycat.org/community-cat-care/whats-the-difference-between-stray-feral-and-pet-cats/">feral cats</a>, although they have fewer vocalizations than some other species. The <a href="https://bigcatrescue.org/jungle-cat-facts/">jungle cat from Asia</a>, for example, has a couple more that are not in the house cat’s repertoire, namely the “ow” and the “gurgle.” The house cat’s characteristic sound, the meow, is hardly ever heard in feral cat colonies, except occasionally when mother cats are communicating with their kittens. Feral cats diligently monitor one another’s comings and goings, so they don’t need to announce their presence vocally. Cats that live with humans, however, learn that meowing is a good way of getting our attention: our pet felines often find that we have our noses buried in a book or a screen, so they meow to get us to acknowledge them. Some pets develop a “private language” of meows that only their owners understand, each signifying something different that the cat needs. Also, certain breeds are notoriously chatty, the <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/facts-about-siamese-cats-4173491">Siamese</a> in particular.</p>
