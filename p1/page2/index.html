	<h2 style="font-size:200%; font-family:Georgia;">Are <a href="../page3/index.html" title="next page">cats</a> less domesticated than dogs? Are they becoming more domesticated over time?</h2>
	<p style="font-size:150%;" class="p2"> Cats are far more similar to their wild ancestors than dogs are to wolves, so dogs are in that sense the more domesticated of the two species. As they adapted to living alongside humans, cats became more sociable with one another and much more accepting of people, but there is no evidence that they have changed much more than that over the past few thousand years.</p>
