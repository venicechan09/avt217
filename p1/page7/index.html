	<h2 style="font-size:200%;">Why do <a href="../page8/index.html" title="next page">cats</a> sometimes suddenly bite or scratch the person who is petting them?</h2>
	<p style="font-size:150%;" class="p2"> You have probably missed the warning signs that the cat has had enough. Some cats, even if they enjoy being petted, also tire of it very quickly. Flattened ears and a slight twitching of the tail can signal that they have had their fill. If you have such a cat, try breaking off from stroking it every few seconds and allow it to move away if it wants to. </p>
	<h3 style="font-size:200%;">Why do cats sometimes suddenly decide to run around like crazy for no apparent reason?</h3>
	<p style="font-size:150%;" class="p2">Cats can get quite frustrated if they are bored or if they are stressed, perhaps because they have just seen a rival cat through the window. Under such circumstances, the slightest movement, perhaps just a speck of dust caught in a shaft of light, can set them off. Regular play sessions can help dissipate all that energy and relieve any stress. </p>
