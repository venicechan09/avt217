	<h2>How can you get a <a href="../page7/index.html" title="next page">cat</a> to love you?</h2>
	<p> Cats naturally feel affection for those who feed, look after and play with them, although they donâ€™t always make that obvious. Trust can be harder to win because some cats are just nervous. One trick is to always allow the cat to approach you rather than forcing yourself on the cat when you feel like it. When the cat does approach, reward it with a few treats and let it leave as soon as it wants to. You should find that it comes to you a little sooner, and stays for a little longer, each time.</p>
