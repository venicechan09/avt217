	<p style="font-size:150%;" class="p2">Cat owners commonly believe that <a href= "https://basepaws.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-cat-fur-patterns-colors-and-markings" title="cat fur patterns"><b>coat color</b></a> can predict the personality of their pet, but thereâ€™s no evidence that this is universally true. Locally, a very successful male can produce a lot of kittens that both look like him and behave like him because of their shared genes, which might explain how people have come to associate coat color with personality. Among pedigree cats, the major breed types do have characteristic personalities: the so-called oriental breeds tend to be particularly active, the exotics more laid-back. Cats that are hybrids of domesticated cats and wildcats exhibit even stronger breed-specific personality traits. For example, Bengals, which are a cross between domestic cats and the Asian leopard cat, tend to be extremely adventurous and sleep for only about half the time that a typical domestic cat does. </p>
